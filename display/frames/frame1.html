        frame is an HTML element which defines a particular area in which another HTML document can be displayed. A
        frame
        should be used within a frameset.

        Using the frame element is not encouraged because of certain disadvantages such as performance problems
        and lack of accessibility for users with screen readers. Instead of the frame element, iframe may be
        preferred.
